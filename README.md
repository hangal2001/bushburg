# System Charter and Description
* Fundraising for Africa project "Bushburg"

Many parts of Africa lack the infrastructure to deliver basic services often taken for granted here, such as education, electricity, clean water, healthcare, etc. Addressing these issues involves solving multiple, complex and interrelated problems. A key problem underlying any undertaking for infrastructure improvement is fundraising to purchase materials and equipment.

The objective of this capstone project is to create a game that utilizes a crowdfunding model to raise money for villages in rural parts of Africa while also raising awareness of how these people live their lives and what types of struggles they face. The game would be like a cross between Oregon Trail and Farmville. It would provide a simulation of life in an African community, performing everyday tasks while working under the limitations imposed by the lack of infrastructure in that community. For example, to eat, one would need to go a significant distance to get water. In addition, the player's avatar as well as his/her community encounters the consequences of being in that environment, such as malaria, starvation, diarrhea and AIDS.

The game provides a way to donate to specific items, such as wells, water filters, mosquito nets, solar panels, drones, computer labs, etc. These donations adjust the circumstances of the game so that the player sees the impact of the donation.

Other features can also be incorporated, such as multi-player support, integration with social networks, etc.

The primary target for the game would include young professionals, stay-at-home parents, people who have a passion for volunteering, etc.

# Communication Management Plan
* We will keep regular and timely email correspondence – requiring a response within 24 hours for normal communication, and a response within 4 hours when communication concerns a group deadline. 
* We will meet in person on Tuesday and Thursday at 11:50am for at least 30 minutes to discuss the current status of the project, set goals, and complete group work if necessary.
* We will rely on Github as our main communication center. Communication directly related to issues should be transacted directly in the issue thread. 
* Issues will be opened and closed with short messages (in addition to a title) that specify the desired actions that need to or have been taken. These can be short!

# Code Management Plan
#### Internal Bushburg team:
* **Before every work session:** individual members must stay consistent with the team by pulling the most current source code from the repo. This will reduce the likelihood of merge conflicts or overwriting significant work. 
* **During work session:** make regular commits with short messages. Contribute to a healthy change log. Commit small and commit often, and we will have a clear history that will help us define future goals and work allocation.
* **After any meaningful change and at the end of every work session:** push all work associated with the change to the repo. Keep the most current code housed in the central repo for other members to access.

#### External use and submissions:
* All submitted code must comply fully with the Apache 2.0 license. 
* Author will retain copyright of code submitted by pull request, regardless of whether or not it makes it into the source. 
* All pull requests will be reviewed and processed based on their relationship to outstanding issues and the issue’s priority. Merging code into the source will be a top priority when the submitted code works to solve outstanding issues.
* All other pull requests will be reviewed and processed in the order they come in. A contribution's value to the overall health will be determined by the SPDXHub internal team.
* Suggestions and critiques for system improvement are welcomed.
